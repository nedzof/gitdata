Great direction. OpenLineage is exactly the right “contract” for lineage if you want interoperability without giving up your BSV/SPV trust model. Below is a practical, opinionated guide that builds on what you have (D41) and turns your questions into concrete, production-ready practices.

TL;DR
- Yes, OpenLineage is customizable via facets. Use them—but do it with discipline.
- Yes, you must use schemas. Treat schemas as your interoperability contracts.
- Standardize identifiers, event lifecycle, and a small set of custom facets that carry your BSV/SPV and policy signal.

What to standardize in your org (contracts you should never change ad-hoc)
- Namespace
  - overlay:<env> (overlay:prod|staging|dev). One namespace per deployment.
- Identifiers (deterministic)
  - dataset.name = <versionId>
  - job.name = publish::<versionId> (or publish::<txid>, but be consistent)
  - run.runId = <txid> (preferred) else sha256(versionId|createdAt)
- Producer field
  - producer: https://<host>/adapter/openlineage/1.0 (versioned URL you control)
- Event lifecycle (minimum)
  - RUN_COMPLETE for publish
  - Optional RUN_START (cosmetic)
  - Optional lifecycle change for recall: lifecycleStateChange = RETRACTED
- Parent edges
  - inputs = parents (from /bundle), outputs = [versionId]
  - Every edge must be derivable from bundle.parents (SPV-first consistency)

Facet design principles (to keep your OL payloads clean and portable)
- Use a small, stable whitelist of facets. Avoid PII and bulky blobs.
- Every custom facet must include:
  - _producer: your org/adapter URL
  - _schemaURL: permanent URL to its JSON Schema
  - version field inside the facet (e.g., "v": "1") for evolution
- Size budget: keep any single facet under ~8–16 KB. OL events should stay light.
- Immutability: facets describing on-chain facts should be immutable after COMPLETE (e.g., txid, contentHash).
- Namespacing: keep facet names short and clear (camelCase), e.g., gitdataSpv, governance, datasetVersion, dataSource.

Recommended facets for your D24 stack
- datasetVersion (standardized “what”)
  - { version:<versionId>, type:"dlm1", contentHash, createdAt }
- dataSource (how to find it in your overlay)
  - { name:"gitdata", uri:"https://overlay/listings/<versionId>" }
- gitdataSpv (your SPV signal)
  - { v:"1", confs, bundleUrl, bundleHash?, txid? }
  - Keep endianness consistent with your /bundle; if you expose txid, document BE/LE.
- governance (your policy signal)
  - { v:"1", policyId, decision:"allow|warn|block", reasons?:[], evidenceHash? }
  - This facet is advisory for visualization; “Verify” still uses /ready.
- gitdataProvenance (light lineage stats)
  - { v:"1", producerIdentityKey?, parentsCount?, lineageDepth? }

Example JSON (custom facet) schemas (minimal)
- gitdataSpv.schema.json
{
  "$id": "https://your-org.com/schemas/v1/gitdataSpv.json",
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["v","confs","bundleUrl"],
  "properties": {
    "v": { "type": "string", "enum": ["1"] },
    "confs": { "type": "integer", "minimum": 0 },
    "bundleUrl": { "type": "string", "format": "uri" },
    "bundleHash": { "type": "string", "pattern": "^[0-9a-f]{64}$" },
    "txid": { "type": "string", "pattern": "^[0-9a-f]{64}$" }
  },
  "additionalProperties": false
}
- governance.schema.json
{
  "$id": "https://your-org.com/schemas/v1/governance.json",
  "type": "object",
  "required": ["v","policyId","decision"],
  "properties": {
    "v": { "type": "string", "enum": ["1"] },
    "policyId": { "type": "string", "minLength": 1 },
    "decision": { "type": "string", "enum": ["allow","warn","block"] },
    "reasons": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" }, "maxItems": 16 },
    "evidenceHash": { "type": "string", "pattern": "^[0-9a-f]{64}$" }
  },
  "additionalProperties": false
}

Validation strategy (don’t skip this)
- Ingest pipeline (D41) must:
  - Validate core OL structure (eventType, run, job, inputs/outputs).
  - Validate each known custom facet against its JSON Schema.
  - Quarantine to DLQ on schema violations; do not admit malformed events.
- Maintain a facet registry:
  - Map facetName → schemaURL (+ local cached copy + version)
  - Only accept whitelisted facets in production.
- Strictness:
  - Start strict in staging, slightly permissive in prod with clear error telemetry.
  - Log any unknown facet names; block if they exceed an allowlist.

Event examples (complete)
- Publish COMPLETE with two parents
{
  "eventType": "COMPLETE",
  "eventTime": "2025-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "producer": "https://overlay.example/adapter/openlineage/1.0",
  "job": { "namespace": "overlay:prod", "name": "publish::vr_cafebabe" },
  "run": {
    "runId": "txid_a1b2c3...",
    "facets": {
      "nominalTime": { "nominalStartTime": "2025-01-01T11:59:58Z" },
      "gitdataSpv": {
        "_producer": "https://overlay.example/schemas/v1",
        "_schemaURL": "https://your-org.com/schemas/v1/gitdataSpv.json",
        "v": "1",
        "confs": 2,
        "bundleUrl": "https://overlay.example/bundle?versionId=vr_cafebabe",
        "bundleHash": "3f8e...a0c1"
      },
      "governance": {
        "_producer": "https://overlay.example/schemas/v1",
        "_schemaURL": "https://your-org.com/schemas/v1/governance.json",
        "v": "1",
        "policyId": "pol_default",
        "decision": "allow",
        "reasons": []
      }
    }
  },
  "inputs": [
    { "namespace": "overlay:prod", "name": "vr_parentA" },
    { "namespace": "overlay:prod", "name": "vr_parentB" }
  ],
  "outputs": [
    {
      "namespace": "overlay:prod",
      "name": "vr_cafebabe",
      "facets": {
        "datasetVersion": { "version": "vr_cafebabe", "type": "dlm1", "contentHash": "deadbeef...", "createdAt": "2025-01-01T12:00:00Z" },
        "dataSource": { "name": "gitdata", "uri": "https://overlay.example/listings/vr_cafebabe" }
      }
    }
  ]
}

Backward/forward compatibility (how to evolve safely)
- Never break job.name / run.runId rules after launch (it breaks idempotency).
- Facets:
  - Additive only (new optional fields). Removing/renaming fields requires a new facet version (e.g., v:"2" + new schema URL).
  - Keep old schemas available forever (stable URLs).
- If you must change namespace format, migrate by writing to a new namespace and freezing the old one.

Security & privacy
- No PII in facets (ever). Prefer hashes or references (URIs) to overlay endpoints.
- Strip raw payloads; store only hashes/ids/URLs.
- Signaling only: use governance facet for decisions, not for full policy bodies.
- Rate limit OL ingest and query; protect write endpoints (token + IP allowlist).

Query/UI considerations
- Drive the viz from your OL query API (D41) only; keep “Verify” separate via /bundle + /ready.
- Depth limits (default 3–5), progressive expansion, and “truncated” flags to keep graphs snappy.
- Surface gitdataSpv.confs and governance.decision as badges; link to bundleUrl for proof.
- Offer both simple and Cytoscape-ready formats to keep front-end swaps easy.

Test plan (golden and negative vectors)
- Golden:
  - No parents → 0 inputs, 1 output; edges match /bundle.
  - Two parents → edges match /bundle exactly.
  - Governance allow/warn/block variations render badges correctly.
  - SPV confs thresholds gate projection (if configured).
- Negative:
  - Unknown facet → reject or quarantine to DLQ, depending on env.
  - Bad schema URL → accept (if facet validates) but log “schema unreachable” warning.
  - Oversized facet → reject.
  - Duplicate events → idempotent (no dup edges/runs).

Operational tips (keep things smooth)
- Maintain a single source-of-truth doc for:
  - Naming rules, facet whitelist, schema URLs, versioning policy, and runId rules.
- Add metrics for:
  - unknown_facet_total, schema_validation_fail_total, governance_decision_count, spv_confs_distribution.
- Periodic audit:
  - Randomly sample edges and compare to /bundle.parents. Expect 100% match.

Answering your two core questions explicitly
- Is OpenLineage customizable?
  - Yes—via facets. Use a small, well-documented set of custom facets (gitdataSpv, governance, gitdataProvenance). Keep them versioned and schema-backed.
- Do you have to use a schema?
  - Yes—and that’s the power. The schema is your contract for interoperability. It prevents drift, makes validation possible, and lets other tools (or future ones) understand your data without special-casing.

If you want, I can produce:
- JSON Schema drafts for all recommended facets (ready to host under your domain)
- A facet registry doc (table of facet → schemaURL → version → owner)
- Golden test vectors and a Postman/Newman suite that validates your OL ingest path end-to-end (including schema validation outcomes)
